# Paint-a-Sketch 98

What started as my assingment: _"Javascript Advanced Oppgave 1: Create a movable object"_

## My idea and how it changed

At first I wanted to make a simple platformer game base. Like a dungeon crawler or something. But the assingment forced me to have the html object move with the mouse so..
I scrapped my original idea. Runing out of planning time I turned to the world wide web for answers to what my project should be. The answer I landed on was a simple idea: an etch a sketch.

So Design wise I landed on making a parody on Windows 98's Paint. This is most likely where I went
overboard and the result is this:

## How to use the Paint-a-Sketch 98:

### Controls:

- **ARROW KEYS:** Move the cursor & draw lines
- **CLICK:** Jump cursor & draw line to click position
- **S KEY:** Erases it by "shaking" (My excuse to use animation)
- **C KEY:** Change drawing color

### Tools:

- **Cursor (Always selected):** Draw with arrow keys or click
- **Other tools:** For decoration only (making the classic Paint vibe complete.)

## Bugs

**A lot.** The title clock idea breaks or starts borken, some desctop icons behaves slightly odd,
some taskbar icons and names fails to show up properly if other windows are already open.
I have no time to fix any more then the ones I've already fixed. But if you find any please tell
me.

# Special Thanks

I wanna shout out two amazing people who have made some of the resources that this project uses and give them a proper thank you.

### Niklas von Hertzen

For his amazing libary _html2canvas._ A library that allows you to take "screenshots" of webpages or parts of it, directly on the users browser.
This is the "secret" behind the "Save" functionality works.

#### Links to his website and GitHub:

### Alex Meub

For his amazing Windows 98 Icon gallery on his blog. This truly made it way easier for me to style the site while also admire the historic old Win98 icon desings.

This project would be **far** worse without their resources and I **highly** recommend you to check them out.
